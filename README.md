# RNA-seq-Salmon-EdgeR
RNA-seq analysis with Salmon and EdgeR

These scripts can be run to analyze RNA-seq data and use the following programs:

  Salmon to quantify reads (for more info, see https://salmon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/salmon.html)
  
  Tximport to generate the count table (https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/tximport.html)
  
  EdgeR to do differential expression analysis (https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/edgeR.html)

  GOseq to perform gene ontology analysis (https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/goseq.html)
